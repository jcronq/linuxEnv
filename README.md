# linuxEnv

This is really just my personal preferences for tools when working with linux.

Currently includes:
* .profile
* .vim
* .vimrc

To install, run install.sh and accept which parts you want by entering 'y' when prompted.

To save current working env (.profile/.vim/.vimrc), run save.sh and select 'y' when prompted.
